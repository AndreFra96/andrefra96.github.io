Hello, I'm Andrea.

Here's a bit about me personally:

- I live in Milan
- I explore the city on my bicycle ðŸš²
- I love late-night coding sessions

And here's a bit about my professional life:

- I work part-time as a full-stack software developer at RCA SRL. Currently, I'm involved in the development of a web application known as T-Order, which serves as a comprehensive tool to streamline the company's various processes.
- I'm also engaged in a side project called Welcapp, which is a web service with the primary goal of enhancing the world of house renting by providing hosts with a centralized platform to communicate essential information to their guests.
